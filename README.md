This project is a web-based Exhaust Gas Calculator built using React. The application allows users to estimate the amount of exhaust gases (such as CO₂, NOₓ, and other emissions) produced by vehicles based on input data such as fuel type, fuel consumption, distance traveled, and engine specifications.
